## Overview

VEIL-AI v1 is a real-time vehicle entry–exit monitoring system optimized for Indian number plates. It runs on edge devices for low-latency, privacy-preserving surveillance and supports offline-first logging with optional cloud sync.

## Key Capabilities

- **License Plate Detection** – Custom-trained YOLO model optimized for Indian plates.
- **Indian ANPR** – Two-line plate handling with EasyOCR + Tesseract fallback.
- **Entry–Exit Tracking** – Vehicle movement logging with multi-frame confirmation.
- **Vehicle Classification** – Private vs. commercial classification.
- **Hybrid Storage** – SQLite for local-first persistence with optional Firebase sync.

## Technical Highlights

- Trained on 50,000+ Indian vehicle images.
- 96%+ plate detection accuracy with confidence-based filtering.
- Regex-validated OCR + line-wise parsing for noisy/stylized plates.
- Edge-first architecture focused on latency and privacy.

## Challenges Solved

- Two-line plate layouts
- Decorative fonts and extra text
- Low-confidence reads in motion/low light

## Next (v2 Roadmap)

- Raspberry Pi deployment
- Edge optimization and latency tuning
- Improved robustness for stylized plates

## Tech Stack

- **Detection**: Custom YOLO
- **OCR**: EasyOCR, Tesseract
- **Storage**: SQLite, Firebase (optional)
- **Language**: Python
