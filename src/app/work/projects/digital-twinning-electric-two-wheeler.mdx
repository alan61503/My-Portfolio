## Conference Spotlight

Presented at the **2nd IEEE International Conference on Vehicular Technology and Transportation Systems (ICVTTS 25)**, this study introduces a full-stack digital twin for electric two-wheelers. The prototype fuses embedded telemetry, cloud analytics, and AR overlays so that riders and operators can interrogate vehicle health in real time.

## System Architecture

1. **Sensing & Edge Compute** – An ESP32 gathers pack voltage, current, and temperature at 10 Hz, normalizes the data, and streams MQTT payloads upstream.
2. **Cloud Telemetry Layer** – ThingSpeak IoT channels log the raw feed, trigger alert automations, and expose REST endpoints for historical analysis.
3. **Augmented Reality Visualization** – A Unity + AR Foundation app renders a 3D twin of the scooter and projects live SoC/SoH/range estimates onto the body panels.
4. **Battery Intelligence Stack** – Hybrid Kalman filtering plus coulomb counting refines all-day SoC, while degradation models output SoH, cycle count, and range confidence bands.

## Key Outcomes

- **Real-time diagnostics** – Sub-second synchronization between the physical scooter and the AR twin meaningfully boosts rider trust.
- **Campus-scale validation** – Tested across the university grounds; telemetry stayed within ±2% of lab references over 60 km of riding.
- **Scalable template** – Modular firmware and cloud topics allow OEMs or fleet operators to extend the twin to additional vehicle classes.

## Impact & Next Steps

The project shows how digital twins can derisk e-mobility deployments by surfacing battery health in an intuitive way. Future work includes OTA calibration, predictive maintenance models, and federated learning to tune estimators per rider without exposing raw telemetry.
