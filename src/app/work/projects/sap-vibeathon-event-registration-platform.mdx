## Overview

Built for the SAP Inside Track Vibeathon – College Student Edition 2025 at Christ University, this platform handles both professional and student registration journeys with real-time validation, secure auth, and live event metrics. The UI ships with light/dark themes, responsive layouts, and a dashboard that keeps organizers updated on attendance, waitlists, and cohort mix.

## Core Features

1. **Dual Registration Flows** – Tailored forms for Professionals and Students, with conditional questions, live field validation, and contextual guidance.
2. **Secure Authentication** – Supabase Auth + RLS ensuring users can only see their submissions; admins enjoy elevated policies for approvals.
3. **Stats Dashboard** – Dynamic charts powered by Supabase/PostgreSQL views display registrations, approvals, and RSVP funnels.
4. **Modern UI/UX** – Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS with theme toggles, keyboard navigation, and motion primitives to keep the experience polished.
5. **Deployment Ready** – CI/CD via Vercel, environment-based Supabase keys, and logging for every registration event.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
