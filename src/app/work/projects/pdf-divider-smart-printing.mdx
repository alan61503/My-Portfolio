## About Splitter

We believe printing and file management should be simple, fast, and stress-free. Splitter is the result—a secure, automated platform that helps students and professionals handle PDFs smarter without wasting time or burning through ink. Upload a deck, let the system classify every page, and download perfectly organized print sets in seconds.

## Overview

Splitter started as a quick personal automation so I could stop wasting ink on lecture packs. It grew into a polished web app that accepts PDFs up to 50 MB, detects whether each page needs color or monochrome output, and generates separate print-ready sets in seconds. The tool is designed around clarity: crisp typography, playful gradients, and a micro-interaction when you drag-and-drop a file, all trimmed for performance across mobile and desktop.

## Highlights

- **Color detection pipeline** – Streams each page through a lightweight worker that checks pixel variance before classifying it as B/W or color. Saves up to 40 % ink on typical university notebooks.
- **Double-sided mode** – Automatically inserts blank backs where needed so duplex printers keep page order intact.
- **Privacy-first uploads** – Files are encrypted in-flight and wiped immediately after processing; no logs, no persistent storage.
- **Eco mode recommendations** – Surfaces copy-friendly tips (like grayscale summaries) after each run so users know how much paper and ink they saved.

## Stack & Implementation

- **Next.js + Vercel** host the reactive front-end and file API routes, with Once UI primitives to keep styling consistent with the rest of my portfolio.
- **TypeScript worker pipeline** chunks PDFs, inspects rasterized canvases, and batches processing so even 40+ page documents finish quickly.
- **Tailored motion system** uses CSS-driven shimmer states on drop targets and reveal effects on the benefits list to keep the interface feeling alive without heavy JS.

## Outcomes

- Reduced school print budgets for early users by ~30 % on average.
- Handles 50 MB PDFs comfortably with user-visible progress, making it viable for dense research decks.
- Served as the foundation for other automation ideas—like tagging marketing decks before they hit the press—and showcases my ability to pair tight UX with gnarly file-processing logic.
