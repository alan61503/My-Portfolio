## Overview

Built for the Kaspersky Hackathon at Christ University, this full-stack web app ingests multi-format content (posts, screenshots, voice notes) and runs them through specialized AI detectors. The goal: deliver a unified, trustworthy verdict so moderators, journalists, and educators can react faster.

## Capabilities

1. **Zero-Shot Text Vetting** – Hugging Face BART zero-shot classifier labels statements as credible, satire, scam, or disinformation without curated training sets.
2. **Visual Integrity Checks** – CLIP embeddings compare suspect imagery against reference captions to flag deepfakes or context-swapped photos.
3. **Audio Scrutiny** – Whisper transcribes short clips and feeds transcripts into the NLP pipeline, while spectral cues flag voice cloning attempts.
4. **Modular Detection Pipeline** – Python/FastAPI orchestrates each modality and normalizes scores into a single risk dashboard for analysts.
5. **Logging & Evidence** – Structured JSON payloads (MongoDB-ready) archive every decision for auditing or appeals.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, Font Awesome icons, fully responsive.
- **Backend & AI**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Torch, NumPy, PIL, Hugging Face Transformers, CLIP, Whisper.
- **Ops**: Docker-ready services with .env-driven model selection and throttled inference queues.

## Impact

- Bridges research-grade multimodal AI with practical moderation tooling.
- Demonstrated at the hackathon to process mixed-media social posts in real time.
- Open-source on GitHub so contributors can extend it with fact-check APIs or newsroom integrations.
